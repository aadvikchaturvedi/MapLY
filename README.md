# MapLY
Traditional GPS systems optimize only for shortest distance/time, ignoring personal safety risks. MapLY solves this problem by using  dynamic safety indicators as existing safety indicators are mostly static, fail under low bandwidth, and do not adequately incorporate real-world crime data, environmental context, or dynamic user feedback.
